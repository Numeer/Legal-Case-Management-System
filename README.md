# Legal-Case-Management-System
 **How it works** 
 - After cloning open the project in ```Microsoft Visual Studio``` 
 - Make sure to replace the ```connectionString``` in ```form1.cs``` with your actual ```service based db path```
 - On running, the login page appears first if the current user enters ```wrong credentials five times``` the account gets ```locked for 30 minutes```
 - On successful login, the ```datagrid``` appears which contains the case names and status.
 - User can ```add, update, delete``` if the user has a ```permission```
 - It contains the role-based access
